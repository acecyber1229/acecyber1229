I'm passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy diving into complex challenges through my hands-on projects. As I work on things like vulnerability management and threat detection, I find each project is a piece of a larger puzzle, helping me build a holistic overview of how different security elements connect in this constantly evolving field. Feel free to take a look at the work I've done to enhance security operations and processes!
